1. HTML is content layer

2. CSS is presentation layer

3. JavaScript is behavior layer

### __Understanding JavaScript__

- An object is the entire webpage (document)

- A method is the the action you want it to do plus the parameter of the action.

- So writing ( 'Good Afternoon' ) is the method in which you get the website to write the parameter 'Good Afternoon'

- The statement is an instruction in java script that the computer should follow

- So when writing `alert('Good Afternoon')` alert is the statement

- JavaScript is used in the HTML with the <script> element.

- Java script is case sensitive

- Curly brackets `{ }` incase code blocks

- A period `.`  is used to seperate the members of the code

- A semicolon `;` tells java script interpreter when a step is 
over

- Also write comments with `/*` to help the JavaScript code be easier to read and understand by you and others
