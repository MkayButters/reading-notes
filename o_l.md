## Comparison and Logical Operators

- __Boolean True or false; Comparison Operators__
    - `==`; is equal to
    - `!=`; is not equal to
    - `===`; strict equal to
    - `!===`; strict not equal to
    - `>`; Greater than
    - `<`; Less than
    - `>`; Greater than or equal to
    - `<=`; Less than or equal to

- Logical operators allow comparison of the results of more than one comparison operator

## Loops

- Loops check a condition and if it returns _true_ a code block will run. It repeats till the condition returns false.


- There are 3 common types of loops
    - __For__

        - Used to run a code a specific number of times. 
        - The condition is usually a counter that tells how many times the loop should run.

    - __WHILE__

        - If unsure about how many times a code should run use this.
        - This will continue to loop the code for as long as the condition is _true_
    
    - __DO WHILE__

        - Very similar to __WHILE__ loop but always runs the statement inside the `{}` at least once even if the condition comes out _false_
