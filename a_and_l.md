# How computers Work

## Binary and Data

- Binary numbers only digits are 0 and 1
- 0 and 1 represnt electricity flow for 1 on and 0 off
- Binary data control every sound image and text on a computer
- A bit is the smallest information a computer can store

## Circuits and Logic

- Circuts proccess information represented by 1's and 0's
- An adder takes in 2 bits to calculate the sums of binary digits
- Modern circuts can preform billions of caculations per secound
- Simple calculations can be performed by humans but are way way faster done by a computer


## CPU, Memory, Input and Output

- All computers input, store, process, and output information
- The input converts physical input to binary information
- The memory stores information
- The cpu processes and calculates information
- The output converts information to a physical output
