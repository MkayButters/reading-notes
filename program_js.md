## Intro + Scripts

- JavaScript cna be used to access content, modify it, program a specific set of step (rules), and react to events.

- Key concepts to be familiar with are __A B C__
    - __A__|  What is a script and how do i create one?
        - A script is a series of instructions
        - To create a script first state the goal and list the tasks that need to be completed to acheive it
        - Then code each step to create the tasks and then complete the overall goal

## Expression + Operators

- An __Expresion__ results in a single value
- 2 Types of __Expressions__
    1. __Expressions__ that assign a value to a variable;

         ie `var color = 'black';`

    2. __Expressions__ that use 2 or more values to return a single value;

        ie. `var area = 3*2;`

- __Expressions__ rely on ___Operators___ which allow creation of a single value from one or more values

- There are many different types of ___Operators___
    - Arithmetic ___Operators___

        - Basicaly the ___Operators___ can use; addition `+`, subtraction `-`, division `/`, multiplication `*`, increment `++`, decrement `--`, and modulus `%`, to mathematicaly calculate variables.

    - String ___Operator___
        - Strings consist of placing the _Operator_ in quotations `" "`, or apostraphies `' '`. 
        
        

## Functions

- A __Function__ lets you group of series of statements together to perform a specific task.

- __Functions__ offer a way to store steps needed to acheive a task

- When its asked to perform its tasks it is known as calling the __Function__

- Peices of information passed to a __Function__ are called _parameteres_

- When a function is expected to answer the response is called a _return value_
